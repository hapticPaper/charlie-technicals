Turning to other data, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow measure forecasts 3.5% growth in the third quarter. That is a tick lower than last week's forecast. The Cleveland Fed Inflation Nowcast calls for a 2.6% rate in December, also lower than last week. Mortgage rates ticked down last week, with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage now at 6.21%, according to FreddieMac. Gas prices were down four cents and are now at an average of $2.90 per gallon for regular gas. Looking ahead, the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting is on January 28. After the latest jobs and CPI reports from last week, the odds for a 25-basis rate cut at this meeting are at 22%, according to the CME FedWatch rate tool.
