Third-quarter earnings season is over, and a hefty number of companies across sectors raised guidance. In fact, so many took that action that we are running this list for a second time in recent months. We view management's ability to raise guidance as a catalyst for market-beating returns in the quarters ahead, and note that raising guidance during uncertain economic times, when vision is murky, is especially difficult. The following is a partial list of companies in the Argus Fundamental Universe of Coverage at which management increased its outlook during the recent reporting season. The notable sector imbalance in our list is partially due to when sectors report in the earnings cycle. For example, Financials report early and, as such, were heavily represented in the first list we produced in late October. \"Management Signals\" is one of our Investment Themes as we close out 2025, and we continue to like this theme as it crosses numerous industries and generates a robust list of potential portfolio candidates.
