From department stores to grocery stores, most retailers across the U.S. close early on Christmas Eve and shut their doors entirely on Christmas Day — while others opt to cut back hours. Before you run out the door this Christmas — whether it’s to buy last-minute gifts or simply get out of the house — it’s wise to double-check operating hours, which can differ depending on their location. Walmart will be closed on Christmas Day — and reopen at 6 a.m. on Dec. 26."}]}
