Stocks continued their (now three-day) upward trajectory off the December 17 low -- and for the old-timers among us, we may have traced out a typical mid-December low. That seasonal low is also known as \"The Only Free Lunch on Wall Street,\" as named by Yale Hirsch, the founder of the Stock Trader's Almanac. There are many other adages that pop up at this time of year: The January Barometer; The Santa Claus Rally; The First Five Days; If Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall; and on and on and on. Today, we discuss The Santa Claus Rally (SCR), as it theoretically begins on Wednesday. It includes the final five days of December and the first two days of January. Going back to 1950, the S&P 500 has been up 77% of the time during this period, with an average gain of 1.26%. While we did see small losses in the past two years, we have never seen three consecutive down years. The worst recent period was in 1999, with the S&P 500 dropping 4%; the best SCR was near the end of the financial crisis in 2008, when the index rose 7.5%. The strongest consecutive period was the four years from 1972 to 1975, when the index rose 3.1%, 6.7%, 7.2%, and 4.3%, respectively. Based on the size of the last bullish reversal pattern for the S&P 500 (from February to June 2025), an initial measured move targets 7,165. The first Fibonacci (FIBO) extension target range would be 7,480 to 7,887. If the index breaks out to all-time highs and completes the current continuous inverse head-and-shoulders formation, an initial target would be 7,300, with the first FIBO extension range running from 7,400 to 7,540.
